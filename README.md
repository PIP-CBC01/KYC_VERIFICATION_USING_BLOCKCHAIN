The process of Know Your Customer (KYC) verification is crucial for financial institutions and other businesses to validate the identity of their clients, ensuring compliance with legal regulations and preventing fraudulent activities. 
However, traditional KYC processes are often time-consuming, costly, and prone to data breaches due to the centralized nature of data storage.
This project, "KYC Verification Using Blockchain," proposes a decentralized solution that leverages the power of blockchain to securely manage and control the sharing of KYC data.
By using blockchain technology, our project aims to create a transparent, tamper-proof, and efficient system for identity verification. This innovative approach streamlines the KYC process, reduces redundancy, and enhances data privacy and security.
